# Lucoa

![Banner](clips/pause.jpg)

Random node.js app that tries to create a video of Lucoa in rhythm to an osu! beatmap. An example can be found [here](https://youtu.be/BEmKtL-62DE).

Note that this project is not finished and will likely never be.

### To-do
- Sync the dance better
- Automatically add music
- Add hitsounds
